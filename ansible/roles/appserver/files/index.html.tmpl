<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>This is the output of a Consul, Consul-Template and Vault demo.</p>
<p>The Database User and Password you see below comes from a Vault instance running on a sperate server, while this html file was created with consul-template</p>
<p>The nginx config that is allowing you to see this was also generated from key/vals stored in consul and was rendered by consul-template as well.</p>
{{ with secret "secret/database" }}
<p> Example database username and password derived from Vault </p>
<p><b>Database User</b>: {{ .Data.user }} <b>Database Password</b>: {{ .Data.password }}</p>
{{ end }}
